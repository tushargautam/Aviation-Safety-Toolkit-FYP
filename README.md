# Aviation Safety Toolkit Using Data Analytics as a Final Year Project
This project includes data analysis of aircrafts. It is a web-based toolkit that maps the aircraft proximity in a vicinity and detects anomalies and risks in mid-air while generating alerts to the pilots.
# 2 Main Subsystems
  # A) Visualization
     A dashboard that visualizes aircraft’s position and maps aircraft direction using angles and co-ordinates 
     1) Description of all In-air Aircrafts
     2) Notifications and alerts to the Pilot
     3) Change Plane at Runtime
        
  # B) Risk Alerts
    Detecting mid-air anomalies using present influencing factors such as speed, co-ordinates and direction 
    Inform the anomaly to   the pilot by generating alerts and notifications using Haversine’s formula
    A 3- tier risk architecture for 3 levels of risks
